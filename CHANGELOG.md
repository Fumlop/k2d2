# todo : next release

Touch-down appel√© depuis le land.
et auto touch down si < altitude
Landing : interdit de de retourner

<!-- ACCORDION SIZES -->
<!-- auto warp option dans execute !!   ------- -->
<!-- progres bar : execute dv + remaing time -->

# v0.8.0
Features :
* Lift v0.1 : UI is quite awfull, but it's working. It uses the KSP 2 SAS to turn in a proper direction during ascent burn
  Just Choose Turn altitudes. you can finalize the orbit using Circle Tool

* Drone Flight v0.1 : Funny way to flight. very expensive in dv ....
  Can Brake agains Surface Speed or in Vertical mode you can choose your V-Speed and fly on Moons.
  Still need improvements :)

Improvements :
* many UI details : main Tabs, added separator, ToolTip position, chapters in settings
* added a progress bar during burn maneuvers
* 

Fixes :
* Correction of serious lags when Ui is opened (Int Fields and focus trouble)
* Execute Node : added more precision options. Corrected the default options values
* Landing : use sea level if above ground :)
* Circularize : Corrected the double coninc patches.

Know bugs :
* Execute node does not work on multi nodes plans ! meaning if you programmed more than one maneuver the dv computed is totally weird....
* Circularize can sometime create invalid node. please remove nodes and retry.

# v0.7.2
* Landing : correction of the collision detection, more accurate but sometime not perfect, just have a try
* Execute : Added options on direction and start burn time
* UI : added Chapters in settings (more compact)

# v0.7.1 : important corrections
* Rebuild with KSP v0.1.2.0 Assemblies
* Landing : Correction for KSP v0.1.2.0, Landing Touchdown was no more detected.
* Warp : Correction of WarpSpeed ratio.
* Execute : Correction of the OverBurn.

# v0.7.0
* Landing v2  : multi phases landing : Quick Warp, Waiting, Brake and Touch-Down
  after the Brake if the altitude is still too high, another cycle will start.
* Tabs shows if an pilot is currently running
* added Hyperbolic circularize.

# v0.6.0 (not released)
* Landing v1

* Corrected the underBurn in the Execute Node. thanks to @Falki from the KSP2 Modders Society.
* Position of window is saved and cannot be sent outside of Screen space.
* UI new Skin. I'm not really sure of this look. I tried to be closer to main KSP2 UI (purple and black)
* ToolTips to avoid long messages in settings
* Editor Fields in timeWarp Settings avoid sending keys to KSP2 (ex : the 1 Numpad that mute sound)
* Time warp correction : no more burn after time (I hope).

[Known_Issues]
* Circularize can create invalid nodes sometimes, still need to check when and why. (cause KSP2 to have Null Pointer Exceptions)
* During Execute node, if the direction is clearly align at the begining, warp is skipped and burn stats. quite difficult to reproduce 100%.

[TODO] before release

* Land : settings: touch down speed !

[TODO] after and perhaps
* Land : no rotation if speed is up during safe warp
* Land : bad transition between safe warp and quick warp.
* Optimisation : use a cache for settings values
* use ui_shown to Update only needed controllers
* set the node to sub controller on clicking run. (perhaps a bad idea)
* correction circularize UI

# v0.5.1
* Rebuild with SpaceWarp 1.0.1 + fix the version number and KSP2 version check

# v0.5.0
* Added Circularize !!! thanks to Mole

# v0.4.0
* Burn dv is computed with quite good accuracy.
* [AutoManeuver] Use dV rather than time to compute burning durtion a thrust ratio.

# v0.3.0
* [internal] added new classes to load and save settings easily.
* Added Settings
* Turn phase : started the sas to maneuvre mode in a proper way
* Time Warp Phase : Added Settings and a more precise safe duration before burn

# v0.2.1
* Rebuild for ksp2 v0.1.1

# v0.2.0
* added Ugly icon in the app bar and title bar
* Renamed to K2-D2

# v0.1.0
